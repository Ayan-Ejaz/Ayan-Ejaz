🧑‍💻 About Me

I am an aspiring Software Engineer passionate about building secure, scalable, and efficient systems.
I love diving deep into the inner workings of complex systems to understand how they function at their core.

Previously, I have worked on web application penetration testing, which has given me strong awareness of common security vulnerabilities in applications.
Now, when I build backend systems, I consciously engineer them with security best practices in mind.

In the past, I built several projects, but unfortunately lost them due to a laptop crash — back then I wasn’t familiar with Git for version control.
Today, I am much more mindful of good development practices and constantly eager to learn, grow, and improve.
