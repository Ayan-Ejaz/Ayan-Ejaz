👋 Hi, I’m @Ayan-Ejaz

🧑‍💻 About Me:

I am an aspiring Software Engineer passionate about building secure, scalable, and efficient systems.
I love diving deep into the inner workings of complex systems to understand how they function at their core.

Previously, I have worked on web application penetration testing, which has given me strong awareness of common security vulnerabilities in applications.
Now, when I build backend systems, I consciously engineer them with security best practices in mind.

In the past, I built several projects, but unfortunately lost them due to a laptop crash because back then I wasn’t familiar with Git for version control.
Today, I am much more mindful of good development practices and constantly eager to learn, grow, and improve.

🛠️ Technical Skills:

Languages:

JavaScript (Node.js), C, C++

Backend:
Node.js, Express.js

Databases:

MySQL, MongoDB

🚀 Goals:

1. Deepen my understanding of backend engineering and system design.
2. Build more secure, scalable, and production-ready backend systems.
3. Contribute to real-world projects and open-source initiatives.

I'm always open to learning new technologies and taking on new challenges!
